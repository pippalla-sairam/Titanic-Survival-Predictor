# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival chances of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models. It involves data exploration, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
   - Understanding the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing data.  
   - Feature engineering (e.g., family size, social class, demographics).  

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Training models using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.  
   - Evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Correlation heatmaps, survival distributions, and feature importance.
